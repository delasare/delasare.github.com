    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago I thought aobut trying to start blogging again on some level. I thought I would give Octopress a spin.
After a couple of misfires I gave up on it and got lazy. For whatever reason today, I felt like hacking on something so I decided to try again. If you are reading this blog post, then you can tell that I have successfully set up my new blog!</p>

<p>Not really sure what I am going to be posting here. I've always said that it would be nice to have a blog if I thought there was something that I had to say...so here we go.</p>
